# Project Overview

In this project we were given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. We were to use [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) to implement test suites.


## How to get this project

1. Download or clone this [repository](https://github.com/LottaJavaMike/) and open in your favorite code editor 
2. Create/edit test suites using the jasmine.js file in the 'jasmine/spec/feedreader.js' file
3. Open the 'index.html' file in your favorite (ahem, Chrome) web browser.
4. Then scroll to the bottom of the page to see the Jasmine test results section
